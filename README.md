# Enums, Dates i Records Exercises 

## Description
This task covers three fundamental Java topics that will help you write clearer, 
safer, and more modern code: enums for representing finite and controlled values, 
dates and times with the Java Time API for robust time handling, and records—a Java 
feature for declaring immutable data classes with less code.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: Enums (enumerations) allow you to define a set of constant values, giving 
them meaningful names and improving code safety. They are very useful for representing 
closed options such as days of the week, priority levels, or entity states. Unlike 
Strings or integers, enums prevent errors from incorrect values and can include 
behavior (methods).

In this level, we will cover creating enums, using them in conditions and classes, 
and how to extract useful information from them.

Level 2: Working with dates and times is fundamental in many projects. Java offers 
the java.time API from version 8 onwards to do this in a robust and clear way, avoiding 
the problems of the old Date class.

You will learn to represent time with precision (LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime), 
perform temporal calculations, compare dates, format them, and work with schedules or 
planning. It is a key tool for developing applications that depend on the calendar.

Level 3: Records are a modern Java feature designed to reduce boilerplate code when we 
only want to encapsulate data. They are immutable by default, automatically provide 
getters, toString, equals and hashCode, and improve code readability.

This section will help you understand how to create and use records, add basic logic, 
validate values, and compare them with traditional classes. It is a very useful tool 
for simple and clear data models.

## Features
- Set up Java projects with Maven or Gradle for testing.
- Write unit tests with JUnit 5.
- Write expressive assertions with AssertJ.
- Apply the TDD cycle (test, implementation, refactoring).
- Separate business logic from input/output to make code testable.
