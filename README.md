# Enums, Dates i Records Exercises 

## Description
This task covers three fundamental Java topics that will help you write clearer, 
safer, and more modern code: enums for representing finite and controlled values, 
dates and times with the Java Time API for robust time handling, and records—a Java 
feature for declaring immutable data classes with less code.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: In this level, we will cover creating enums, using them in conditions and classes, 
and how to extract useful information from them.

### Implementation:
- Ex1: Day enum with weekend checking method
- Ex2: Task class with Level enum priority-based processing
- Ex3: LevelColor enum with constructor and property getters
- Ex4: String-to-enum conversion with error handling

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- Ex1: Basic enum creation and instance methods
- Ex2: Using enums as class properties with switch statements
- Ex3: Enum constructors and encapsulated properties
- Ex4: Enum.valueOf() with exception handling and case-insensitive parsing

Level 2: Dates and Times - This level focuses on modern date/time manipulation using 
Java's Time API.

### Implementation:
- Ex1: Display current date and time using LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime
- Ex2: Calculate differences between dates using Period and Duration
- Ex3: Add/subtract days, months, and hours from dates
- Ex4: Format dates in multiple formats using DateTimeFormatter
- Ex5: Check if a given date is before today
- Ex6: Simple appointment agenda with LocalDateTime storage and upcoming appointments display

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- Ex1: java.time package basics and now() methods
- Ex2: Period for date differences, Duration for time differences
- Ex3: Date arithmetic with plus/minus methods
- Ex4: Custom date formatting patterns and locale-specific formats
- Ex5: Date comparisons using isBefore() and isAfter()
- Ex6: Real-world application with appointment management and filtering
