# Enums, Dates i Records Exercises 

## Description
This task covers three fundamental Java topics that will help you write clearer, 
safer, and more modern code: enums for representing finite and controlled values, 
dates and times with the Java Time API for robust time handling, and records—a Java 
feature for declaring immutable data classes with less code.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: In this level, we will cover creating enums, using them in conditions and classes, 
and how to extract useful information from them.

### Implementation:
- Ex1: Day enum with weekend checking method
- Ex2: Task class with Level enum priority-based processing
- Ex3: LevelColor enum with constructor and property getters
- Ex4: String-to-enum conversion with error handling

### Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- Ex1: Basic enum creation and instance methods
- Ex2: Using enums as class properties with switch statements
- Ex3: Enum constructors and encapsulated properties
- Ex4: Enum.valueOf() with exception handling and case-insensitive parsing

Level 2: (empty)

Level 3: (empty)

## Features
- Set up Java projects with Maven or Gradle for testing.
- Write unit tests with JUnit 5.
- Write expressive assertions with AssertJ.
- Apply the TDD cycle (test, implementation, refactoring).
- Separate business logic from input/output to make code testable.

## Technologies
- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA. Community Edition
- Version Control: Git

## Installation and Execution
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Configure JDK (Java 21).
4. Run the main class of each exercise directly from the IDE.
